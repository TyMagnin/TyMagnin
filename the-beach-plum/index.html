<div class="text-content">
	<p>The <a href="http://www.beachpluminn.com/#about" target"_blank">Beach Plum</a> & <a href="http://www.menemshainn.com/" target"_blank">Menemsha Inn</a> are located on a hill in Chillmark surrounded by beautiful gardens and pastures and overlooking the Vineyard Sound.<br><br>Menemsha is an old fishing village located on the west coast of the island. The main house was actually built with salvaged wood from ship wrecks, and it's an under ten minute walk to the Menempsha Village and a public beach.</p>
	<p>The two inns are within a stones throw from one another and <a href="/weekend/">the weekend's activities</a> will take place between both throughout the weekend.</p>

	<p>The Beach Plum is a unique venue on the Vineyard that prides itself on sourcing its food exclusively from the Vineyard and its surrounding waters.</p>

	<h3>Booking your stay</h3>
	<p>We've blocked off rooms for everyone at The Beach Plum (family) and Menemsha Inn (friends) from Wednesday the 22nd 'til Sunday the 26th. We will be there from Wednesday on, and you're welcome to stay for the duration or simply for the weekend's event.<br><br><b>Call to book your room via The Menemsha Inn (both family and friends) at <a href="tel:+5086452521">(508) 645-2521</a> and tell them you are coming for the Gish-Magnin wedding</b>. Take a peak online first <a href="http://www.menemshainn.com/" target="_blank">if you'd like</a>. Most of the rooms at The Menemsha are cottages, so there are some great options for groups.</p>
	<h3>Traveling to the Inn</h3>
	<p>The best source for ways to travel is on <a href="http://www.mvy.com/get-here/index.aspx" target="_blank">mvy.com</a>, but should you like our recommendations, they are as follows:</a>
	<p><b>From Boston:</b> Grab <a href="https://tds.peterpanbus.com/" target="_blank">a bus</a> or a ride to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Boston,+MA/Woods+Hole+Steamship+Authority,+Cowdry+Road,+MA/@41.9426249,-71.3531502,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e3652d0d3d311b:0x787cbf240162e8a0!2m2!1d-71.0588801!2d42.3600825!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e4da0c3569aa2f:0xf033e6cced49e15f!2m2!1d-70.6700572!2d41.5224331!3e0" target="_blank">Woods Hole, Falmouth</a>. You can park your car there or bring it onto the ferry. If you want to take your car over, it's a good idea as the Inn is a significant drive from Oak Bluffs and you may want to explore the island. But, if you plan to take your car over, <a href="https://www.steamshipauthority.com/reserve/144390837115/select_dates" target="_blank">BOOK THAT NOW</a>! It fills up rediculously early.<br><br>Either way, the ferry arrives in Oak Bluffs, and you can grab a taxi—there are no Ubers on MV—to Chillmark. It's a decent trip, so may be wise to coordinate travel. Or grab a rental car.</p>
	<p>You could also travel <a href="http://capeflyer.com/reservations-tickets/capeflyer-trainpricing-routes/#sthash.hQThmh1Z.dpbs" target="_blank">by train</a> to Hyannis and grab a ferry from there.
    <p><b>From New York City:</b> There is <a href="http://seastreak.com/ferry-routes-and-schedules/between-new-jersey-new-york-city-marthas-vineyard/">a ferry</a> directly to the Vineyard from E. 35th St in NYC. Other options may be to fly directly to 'MVY' or to travel through Boston (see above).</p>
    <p><b>From afar:</b> You can fly directly into <a href="http://www.mvyairport.com/airlineinfo/index.php" target="_blank">the Vineyard's airport 'MVY'</a>, which is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=mvy+to+the+beach+plum+inn&oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIl6vz_aKnyAIViVg-Ch1GXQse" target="_blank"> a 20m cab ride</a> from the Inn. Or you can fly into Boston where you can rent a car, or follow the ideas 'From Boston' above.</a></p>
